<h1 align="center"> Program to convert speech to text </h1>

<p> This program recognizes the speech and them converts to text, with the "speech_recognition" library and the <strong> Google Web Speech API</strong> </p>

<p> The logic is pretty straight forward, you get the user to say something and them converts it to text via API, so make sure to have a internet connection to test this out</p>

<p> This code can be easily incorporated into speech assistances for a better search into the web </p>
